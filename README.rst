Implementation of Weighted Higher Order Multivariate Markov Chains (Markov Models)`
======================================i===========================================

This package contains Markov Models implmentation in Python. You will see 3 implementations
1. NaiveMarkov -is the higher order Markov Model
2. Weighted Higher Order Markov Model
3. Weighted Higher Order Multivariate Markov Model as given in the following paper.
